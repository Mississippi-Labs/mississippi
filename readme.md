## 1. Project Name: Mississippi
## 2. Brief Intro
Mississippi is a fully on-chain PVP rogue-like game deeply integrated with Loot and Realms. We have accomplished Version 1.0 in 2 months, try out the game now: https://test.0xmssp.xyz

The current version features a **rogue-like mining system** and a **cryptography-based real-time PVP system**. Players will explore and extract as many gems as possible in the massive cavern while competing with others.Our item system is completely based on **Loot bags**, strongly empowering Lootverse assets with utilities.

In the next version, players will be able to **upgrade the items** with gems or resources generated by Realms NFTs. Stronger equipment will give you higher mining efficiency and combat attributes.

The equipment synthesis system allows for tremendous depth in the game. It allows you to behave as gatherers, selling gems and basic equipment, or as attackers, protecting the team to escort resources for the synthesis of high-level equipment, or as whale players, mass synthesizing equipment by taking risks and aiming for the top spot on the leaderboard.

Our long-term goal is to establish an SLG (simulation game). Rogue-like mining serves as the foundation for acquiring basic treasures, while our alliance and team system will complement this with a range of PVP battles and the synthesis of resources. This system also allows players to form **nations on-chain**, with customizable systems and governance established as long as they remain united and adhere to a common goal. In this way, We will explore **Autonomous Worlds**.
